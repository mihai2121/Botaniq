# Botaniq

Develop a service-oriented system offering features for botanical gardens [cartography](http://www.programmableweb.com/category/mapping/apis?category=19978), including various digital ways to explore and display educational information about various species of plants. Additionally, the application will be able to manage various dataflows/workflows concerning guided tours, art exhibitions (e.g., the annual Chrysanthemums autumnal exhibition), taxonomic-oriented studies (i.e. learning about plant classification), specific activities (plant conservation, soil preparation, seeding procedures, pollution prevention, etc.) and others. For each item (thing), the user could specify useful information like comments, images, relations with other near-by objects (for example, "Rosa bunda" variety of roses is placed in the centre of the rosarium section of the Botanical Gardens of Iasi). Available knowledge will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint, in conjunction to other sources of interest such as [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/OnlineAccess) and/or [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Bonus: adopting [natural user interactions](http://profs.info.uaic.ro/~busaco/teach/courses/hci/hci-film.html#week13).
